## Overview

Machine learning models for Anti-Money Laundering (AML) transaction monitoring and suspicious activity detection in a major European bank.

## Features

- **Real-time scoring** of transactions for suspicious patterns
- **Anomaly detection** using deep learning techniques
- **Network analysis** for identifying complex money laundering schemes
- **Explainable AI** for compliance and audit requirements
- **Continuous learning** pipeline for model updates

## Technical Approach

- Large-scale data processing with PySpark
- Deep learning models built with PyTorch
- Feature engineering for financial transaction patterns
- MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning
- Integration with existing banking infrastructure

## Impact

Enhanced detection capabilities while reducing false positives, enabling the compliance team to focus on genuine risks and maintain regulatory compliance.
